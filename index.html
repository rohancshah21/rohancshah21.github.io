            <p>Currently, I am working on an offshoot of the hedged sports betting project. Our team is developing a
              centralized market exchange for English Premier League betting; specifically, since most sportsbooks "lie"
              on their odds and provide an edge that prevents users from getting the total amount of return they
              deserve, we seek to generate our own odds on soccer matchups by training an ML model to identify which
              teams are most likely to win and then rebalancing our odds based on those sentiments. This rebalancing
              also takes into account the current odds for upcoming matchups provided by sportsbooks, as these are
              important to provide an initial baseline for our "better" odds.</p>
            <p>For me, I am working more on the application side, interfacing with <b>Flask</b> on the backend,
              <b>React</b> on the frontend, and <b>Amazon Web Services</b> for our database storage for the ML model.

            <br>
            <p>
              I set up an entire local server on the backend that enables our rebalancing team to trigger a rebalance
              whenever better odds are generated by our ML model. Further, the odds being displayed on the actual
              website are being pulled from a third-party API service (displaying the highest positive odd on the
              underdog and the least negative odd on the favorite). It was important to develop an interactive site that
              has clearly defined pages and buttons for users to put mock bets on a scenario, which we additionally
              store on a <b>DynamoDB</b>.

            <p>This passion project of mine that I brought to Cornell Data Science involved finding opportunities to
              exploit arbitrage via sportsbook webscraping, JSON parsing, and arbitrage calculations. <b>Arbitrage</b>
              is defined as a scenario where two different sportsbooks have alternate odds expectations on a matchup;
              because of this, placing bets on both sides of the match in both sportsbooks can theoretically make the
              risk zero.</p>
            <p>I utilized <b>BeautifulSoup</b> to scrape data from American and offshore sportsbooks, while overseeing
              Python request management as some sportsbooks prevent to many pings to their data. Further, I extraced
              JSON data from a third-party odds aggregating API, and parsed through large responses to get the necessary
              data we needed (sportsbooks names, odds for both teams, etc. for all matchups in the sport).</p>

            <img src="assets/rapid-api.png" id="rapid-img" width="600" height="300">

            <br>
            <p>Shown above is a sample API output from the third-party service. I had to go through this large
              dictionary of data and develop a class structure in Python to store "events", and then identify the key
              tags that were critical for an arbitrage calculation on a matchup. The right image shows a Pandas
              dataframe from another third-party API for a series of baseball games. As indicated by the arbyHA and
              arbyAH columns, the higher the first percentage in the tuple the more likely an arbitrage opportunity
              exists.</p>
            <p>We found that over all opportunities found, arbitrage trading led to higher profits in 46.3% of scenarios
              compared to traditional betting on the favorite. This project was interesting in examining an alternative
              betting strategy by leveraging computer science fundamentals, but also demonstrated that such a strategy
              is most likely not feasible for most people unless they have a large amount of data and capital to gamble
              on.</p>

            <p>In this project, I worked on the cloud architecture team in supporting a cloud options trading bot.
              Specifically, the strategy chosen by the other team was to use a long straddle (buying a put and a call on
              the same contract) so as to theoretically guarantee risk. In my role, I specifically worked on developing
              the entire stack on <b>Amazon Web Services</b> by writing out our cloud components (DynamoDB, EventBridge,
              Lambda) in <b>Python</b>. I also worked to integrate this with the strategy side, which had to
              webscrape news headlines from Bloomberg, generate sentiment on it with a small Hugging Face model, and
              write
              the profit of exercising the strategy to our database.</p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>
              The above image outlines our cloud architecture for the bot's stack. We used AWS <b>Step Functions</b> to
              link together the subsequent functions of the strategy: webscraping from Bloomberg, feeding those
              headlines
              into the LLM model to get a positive or negative output, and then exercising the strategy when favorable
              and
              keeping track of that profit in the CurrentOptions database.
            </p>
            <p>
              One unexpected difficulty was the fact that we had to leverage <b>Docker</b> to support the dependecies
              for each of our lambda functions. This was because the LLM model was too large to be supported by AWS. In
              defining Dockerfiles as shown in the below image, we were able to allocate more space for our lambda
              functions and create more complicated strategy functions, overall increasing the robustness of our bot.

            <p>For our final project as part of CS 3110: Intro to Functional Programming at Cornell University, my group
              developed a

              their
              Tamagotchi pet, and buy different trinkets from the in-game currency.</p>

            <p>In this project during my first semester as a full member of Cornell Data Science, I worked with two
              other students in analyzing the optimal
              times to employ momentum vs mean-reverting trading strategies. We did this via a common financial
              indicator known as the <b>Hurst</b> exponent.
              When the exponent is closer to 0, the stronger the mean-reversion process is. The closer to 1, the more
              likely the process is to be trending.
              By implementing a basic <b>simple moving average</b> strategy and a <b>bollinger band</b> mean reversion
              strategy in <b>Python</b> and testing
              them on Nasdaq stocks with a market cap over $2 billion by finding the Hurst exponent on the time series
              data for each stock, we found the following:
              <br>
              <img src="assets/hurst-graph.png" id="hurst-img" width="300" height="300">
              <br>
              From this, we found that when Hurst exponent analysis was applied to indicate when to use a mean-reverting
              or momentum strategy compared to vanilla
              mean-reversion/momentum trading, it places risks and returns somewhat between the SMA and Bollinger Band
              strategies, effectively hedging risk.
            </p>
            <p>
              We extended upon this by proposing a reinforcement learning algorithm called <b>Q-learning</b>, which
              encode the expected value of taking certain actions
              in certain states, by learning the expected payoff of an action over a training period. The results were
              promising, as when the algorithm only acted when it expected a payoff it could achieve high returns.
              However, when forced to act in all scenarios it performed badly. This could imply that the algorithm was
              better at finding strategies when trained across multiple stocks and time intervals.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project overall gave me a great introduction into the power of data analysis, finance, and technology
              all intersecting into one cohesive project. It also made me excited to stay with Cornell Data Science for
              my college career!
